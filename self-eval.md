# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Definitely harder, but very satisfying finding the right answer!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I think I have a great system going. I have been very happy with it so far.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
Patience and keeping to my routine are what I feel I will need to stay on top of things. I am ready to get started.
